# Sudoku-Solver-With-Backtracking-Algorithm

This project is an automated Sudoku Solver utilizing the Backtracking algorithm in Python. In this project, I incorporated a user-friendly GUI via Tkinter. 
This project features functionality for randomized Sudoku board generation and automated solving. This project is inspired by a TechWithTim project, with several additional features. 
I wanted to create the same kind of Sudoku Solver, but I utilized the Tkinter library for the GUI instead of Pygame. I also included the randomized solving, and buttons 
for the user to interact with the program. This is an both a unique implementation and an improved version of the project.
